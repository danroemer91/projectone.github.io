<h1> Daniel Roemer <h1>

<p> I am currently a graduate student here at Eastern Washington University in the MSC program. I am taking this class striving to learn web design. Upon graduation, I hope to eventually teach at a university and pursue my passion for screenwriting.</p>

<p> I aspire to make a difference in the lives of my students. I want to do this by teaching and instilling a passion for writing. I also aspire to write one day an award winning screenplay. Another goal I have would be to see as much of the world as possible including one day traveling to Ireland. </p>

<p> Gone Girl is one of my favorite books of the moment because novelist Gillian Flynn crafted a terrific, suspensful story that is a perfect example of unreliable narrator at its best. We don't know throughout the story who we can really trust among the characters and this is what makes the book so excellent. I highly recommend reading this scary, suspensful, and sometimes darkly humorous novel. </p>
